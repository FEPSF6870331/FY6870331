        To paraphrase Einstein: ‘The cosmological constant was my greatest blunder. (?)’ (Siegel, n.d.) As with modern cosmology this may increasingly be called into question. With the advent of Lemaitre and Hubble’s theories and observations concerning the expansion of the cosmos, it would appear in hindsight the question mark is appropriate. 
However, it is unclear to what extent what we call dark energy, (the energy that results in the universes expansion), is in fact due solely to the cosmological constant, dark energy being a major open question in contemporary open question in contemporary theoretical physics. 
This is in large part as it would result in the so called ‘worst prediction in physics’ were it true. This leaves the question open as to whether what is known as vacuum energy is the culprit, a fifth fundamental force, or a yet further unknown.

       At first developed to account for a static, eternal universe, limited to our galaxy, the cosmological constant was needed due to the problem that general relativity could not allow for a static uniform cosmos as if spacetime curves the attractive nature of gravity shall ensure that, yet further mass is drawn in producing a runaway effect causing cosmic contraction. (Siegel, n.d.) 
To counteract this, a perfectly uniform distribution of matter on a cosmic level was proposed, as seen in his altered equations that accounted for a balancing cosmological constant with the lambda symbol.


This however, (even before Hubble’s observational verifications), was questioned by Russian physicist, mathematician and meteorologist Alexander Friedmann, who noted in 1922 varying values of the cosmological constant could provide varying behaviours in a multitude of universes, not necessarily being static, but allowing for expansion, contraction or oscillation, acceleration and deceleration. (Siegfried, 2022)
Interestingly the poet Edgar Allan Poe first suggested a universe originating in a single particle in an 1848 poem called Eureka, and it is noted that these men were aware of Poe, though Poe left no mathematical deductions he may have provided inspiration. (Siegfried, 2022)
This however was more of a mathematical than physical exercise, with Lemaitre being the first in 1927 to reinvent Fridmann’s mathematics, (he was unaware of Fridmann), and suggest an origin in a ‘primeval atom’. (American Museum of Natural History, 2019) with what are known as the Fridmann-Lemaitre equations. 
These allow for a universe that is, (in non-Euclidean geometry), collapsed and closed, expanding and open, of flat and static.  
  

By doing this Lemaitre in essence invented Hubble’s law 2 years prior to Hubble’s 1929 discovery of said law. This being that the further a galaxy is from the observer, the faster it should appear to be moving away. Lemaitre presented this law as v=CD, v being velocity, C being the universal constant of expansion, while D is the distance. (Tipler, 2018)
But as Lemaitre was unaware of Friedmann, Hubble was unaware of Lemaitre, resulting in Hubble’s law of v=HD, the universal constant being known as Hubble’s constant. (This is thus sometimes known as the Lemaitre Hubble law).  (Tipler, 2018)
Hubble independently came to his conclusion via observation as opposed to the intricacies of general relativity. This was derived from the astronomical observation for the existence of other galaxies. Furthermore, they were receding with a velocity proportional to their distance to us. Due to the doppler effect upon light this results in a slight redshift, while those approaching us are possessed of a blue shift. (Bahcall, 2015) Such observations of red shifting of what were called "nebule" were made by Vesto Slipher in 1917 but not fully understood, as the notion of extra-galactic objects was conjecture. (Siegel, n.d.)

This provided the first real empirical basis for an expanding universe. Thus, Einstein’s field equations may be written as: Guv=8πG(Tuv-Pde Guv)
  
(Siegel, n.d.)
This however does not demonstrate what is making the universe expand, or if it is in fact a constant, (Fridmann noting it could accelerate, corroborating the findings of Nobel prize winners in the 1990’s). It is what is known as dark energy, which though it may be a physical constant is oft approached more as a type of energy, though its essence remains speculative. 
One of the speculations that have proved uniquely embarrassing for scientists is the notion that it could be due to ‘vacuum energy’, or the energy of ‘empty’ space. This is hardly empty, either in flat spacetime, nor in the curves, mentioned earlier due to the equations of Fridmann necessitating the cosmic bends in the open model this shaping requires force and hence an underlying energy inherent in all spacetime as opposed to being truly zero. This gives rise to what is known as virtual particles in quantum mechanics.  
This energy inherent within spacetime create virtual particles which appear and annihilate each outer rapidly, thus not breaking the conversation of energy. This creates a negative energy, pushing instead of pulling. (Kruesi, 2018)
 However, this is commonly called ‘the worst prediction in physics’, by multiple sources, as it would need to be 120 orders of magnitude greater than it is. This is very problematic, as dark energy accounts for 68.3% of the cosmos, baryons, (Us and all we see!), around 4.9%. these calculations may point to a flaw in general relativity, quantum mechanics, or both. (Pomeroy, 2023)
A final factor to consider is the role of inflation, a hypothetical period of rapid, exponential expansion in accordance with Fridmann’s open model mentioned prior, before gravity set in. this would explain the absence of magnetic monopoles, the flatness problem: why the current universe appears flat as in Fridmann’s model, and why the cosmic microwave background is the same in all directions. However, as there are so many variables, it is notably lacking any concise mathematical model. (Bang, n.d.) 
To conclude, this is a brief summary of the mathematical models describing the expansion of the universe, their history, as well as underlying and open problems with such models.
